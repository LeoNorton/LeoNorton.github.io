            My name is Leo Norton in default reality. I'm 18 years old and am a rising sophomore at Northeastern
            University! I'm from the hippie-outdoorsy-beautiful town of Boulder, Colorado. I have way too many projects
            in programming, designing, and building things! I've been
            programming since I was programming javascript and a kid ambasador for a programming startup called BitsBox
            in 4th grade (maybe a little before that as well). I love programming games, I do almost all of them in
            Unity. <br>
            <br>
            In recent years,
            I've been getting into electronics. Everyone thought I would major in C.S. but I decided that I wanted to
            work with my hands a bit more and went into electrical engineering! I also love making art including my
            costumes, and other art which can be found in the <a class="text-link" target="_blank"
                href="MiscPage.html">MISC</a> section. Every intellectual pursuit should have a
            little art mixed in!

            <p>

                In high school, I spent a full calendar year programming <a class="text-link" target="_blank"
                    href="CowboyHell.html">Cowboy Hell</a> and started NortWare LLC in 2023.
                Afterward, I went on to run our school's game development club. In college, I was lucky enough to aquire
                a team in our "Game Studio Club" to help me on the next big game, <a class="text-link" target="_blank"
                    href="Heqet.html">HEQET</a>! Apart from managing this team,
                I also am vice-president of the unicycling club, I run the electrical engineering team in the "Theme
                Park Engineering Club", and will be helping run electronics workshops for the glorious: "Wireless
                Club".<br>
                <br>
                Apart from that, I also avidly attend sewing club, game development club(different from
                game studio), and some others.

            <h2>Non-Technical Stuff</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of academics, I love to roller skate! I have been roller skating since first grade and use it
                heavily as transportation. I have spent a decade skiing and you can catch me doing extreme terrain in
                the winter time. I unicycle a lot and am trying to improve my skills for running unicycling club! I have
                done a ton of scuba diving and have four different specialty certifications (will soon have my "dive
                master" certification!).<br>
                <br>
                I am a big <strong>burner</strong>, not just that I like to light things on fire, but I love the Burning
                Man festival. This summer will be my 6th time there. A bunch of my projects are inspired by Black Rock
                City.<br>
                <br> I
                play the guitar, mandolin, and banjo and have been playing for around four years. I exclusively listen
                to and play the genre of "folk-punk". Don't ask me why or look that up.

            <h2>Professional Work!</h2>
            <p>
                In 7th and 8th grade I was employed at a small virtual reality software startup called Reality Garage. I
                made one of those VR museum exhibits and competed in the NIST CHARIoT challenge on a few-person team! We
                won
                an award for "Most Creative Method of Interation With AR Prototype". <br>
                <br>
                In 11th grade I worked at <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="NIST.html">NIST</a> in the PML lab
                in Boulder, making a
                remote-analog-voltage-driver-for-high-speed-polarization-switches (crazy). That was for a quantum
                entanglement test. In 12th grade, I switched teams and continued to work at NIST on
                quantum-optical-to-microwave-transduction-for-superconducting-quantum-computers! On man these are tongue
                twisters.<br>
                <br>
                I am currently working at NREL in Golden, CO, implementing a system to model energy grid loads for
                hydrogen
                cell fueling for medium/heavy duty vehicles. I'm adding this feature to an existing modeling software
                called
                EVI-Ensite.<br>
