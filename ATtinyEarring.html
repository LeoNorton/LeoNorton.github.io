                Electronic earrings present a lot of mechanical challenges due to their size. I like making
                interesting jewelry and also love building <em>small-tiny-miniscule</em> electronics, so I took on
                the challenge!<br>
                <br>
                I feel the main difficulty in making electronic stud earrings is passing electrical signals <strong>though</strong>
                a single ear-hole. If the battery is placed behind the earlobe, there's really only room for one cable
                to run to a circuit on the front (unless you have your 2nds). One of the only consumer light-up
                earrings solves this by using a <em>tiny co-ax cable</em> and a somewhat clever coin battery pack. I yoinked this
                precision-manufactured cable and battery pack to power my own earring designs.<br>
                <br>
                To the left is a video of one of my first designs, a simple 4-led blinker powered by an <strong>DIP ATtiny85!</strong>
                The SMD LEDs and current limiting resistors are all soldered onto a tiny piece of perfboard which is
                connected to the chip and the earring post.

                        Here I am wearing the earring! It's a pretty subtle effect but I think it's nice.

                        I 3D printed this cute earring box for it since it's relatively fragile. It even comes with
                        spare battery compartments!

                My first earring here was a little bulky for my liking, most of the size is from using the
                fairly large <strong>DIP-8</strong> package of the ATtiny. In the future, I'll be switching this out for
                smaller <strong>SMD</strong> packages or even the tiny tiny <strong>QFN</strong> package (as seen above) if I make a custom
                PCB for the earring. All ICs pictured above are ATtinys of various sizes and processors.

                        rechargable LIPO battery. The wiring is tight!! I guess people make PCBs for
                        a reason.

            <strong> I actually have created two more earrings, one dangly, and one more stud which I
                need to add onto this page, somehow I don't have any pictures of them right now...</strong>
