        <p style="text-align: left;">
            I am currently working on a brand-new tesla coil circuit and setup which uses the so called
            <em>quasi-continuous-waveform (QCW)</em> topology. This tesla coil is my most advanced TC circuit so far,
            built off an electrically isolated driver circuit which uses analog components and ASICs to generate
            a PWM signal pulse with precise timing, frequency, and duty cycle. <strong>The mains-power AC signal is used
            as a signal generator</strong> to create a PWM signal with increasing duty cycle.<br>
            <br>
            To the left is a video of the coil in action! Check out the arc lengths and its ability to easily light
            a large compact-florescent bulb! This is a video of my first full power test with the coil, I'm still working
            on getting much more arc-length out of this design!

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The schematic above represents the medium-frequency driver for my new tesla coil's printed circuit board. The
            only aspect not represented above is the power supply circuits on the board. Much of the topology is similar
            to other dual-resonant tesla coils. I opted for an all analog approach with a PWM signal being generated
            by 555, schmitt-trigger, and flip-flop ASICs as supposed to a microcontroller.<br>
            <br>
            The top circuit generates a PWM signal with pulses synced up to go high during the mains-AC sine wave's first
            quarter. This is achieved through two 555 timers, one with the AC signal applied to it's trigger pin. Two potentiometers
            control the pulse width and frequency.<br>
            <br>
            This interrupter signal is fed into the clear pin of a D flip-flop. Along with a filtered feedback signal from
            induced voltage on an antenna. The final ramped-duty cycle PWM is generated. This is fed into a set of gate driver
            ICs which drive the gate drive transformer in the center of the board. <br>
            <br>
            This drives the gates of the two IGBTs which switch the rectified mains power to the primary coil. This induces
            a very long duration ramped resonant signal with high power through the two coils. This project is yet to
            be completely finished, to it's full power form, stay tuned!

        Driver-less Solid State Tesla Coil!

        <p>
            I would regard this tesla coil as a proper<strong> Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC)</strong>. It switches the primary
            off a large power mosfet which again, uses feedback from a direct electrical connection to the base of
            the secondary.<br>
            <br>
            This circuit runs right off of wall power at<strong> 120V input!</strong> The sparks coming out of this thing are
            slightly lower frequency with a smaller coupling coefficient causing loooong sword streamers!
            I've been getting ~6in streamers from this coil. I believe this circuit hits a<strong> few hundred kilovolts.</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong><----- This</strong> is a video of one of my first tests: using the coil to light a bulb and playing with the
            tips of the sword arcs. You can't actually feel yourself getting electrocuted due to the high frequency
            of the voltage. A lot of people talk about the dangers of internal burns and nerve damage, the latter
            of which, I'm not sure about, but I do tend to conduct the arc through a screwdriver to prevent burns.

        <p>
            Here's the circuit driving the coil, it actually runs off an<em> IRFP460</em> mosfet, which is rated for 200V and
            20A. I bias the input to the threshold voltage with a resistor network and try to drain off
            spikes at the gate with a 12V TVS diode. Despite a direct electrical connection with the
            large primary inductance and high secondary voltage, the major protection for this mosfet comes
            from the<strong> 12V TVS diode</strong> from gate to source and the<strong> 200V TVS diode</strong> from drain to source. This circuit
            is more robust than the simple slayer exciter, but still easily breaks from a voltage spike into ground
            or overheating of the HV TVS diode. Note that the wiring schematic doesn't actually reflect my circuit, sorry.

                <p>Here's a full power test in wireless club. You'll notice that
                the arc forms at the center of the secondary, not at the top load. This
                is undesirable, I believe this is due to slow switching of the mosfet, which
                should have a dedicated gate driver circuit.<strong> Still many more things to fix!</strong> </p>
